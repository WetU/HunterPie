## <ion-icon name="unlink-sharp"></ion-icon> HunterPie Account - Hunt Export

The Hunt Export dashboard has been added, it is still a very new and will be actively worked on in the upcoming updates, the goal is to make it as accurate and useful possible, with uptimes, damage points, information from party members, monsters, quest details, etc.

As of today, it currently displays:

- Quest time
- Real hunt time (how long it actually took to hunt down a monster)
- DPS graph
- Party members
- Enrage uptime for each monster
- Abnormalities uptimes
- Quest details

> **Attention:** Exported SOS quests are still not accurate due to how they work. That will be worked on in the future.
